This Laravel Music List is made by connecting multiple Models and Authentication to make a music list per user.

After registering / logging in as a user which is made possible by proper Authentication, you can read, create, edit, and delete your own music lists and songs. You can also add an image per music list and per song.

When you click the music list, you will then get all of the song information such as album name, artist name, year of making, and the link to spotify.

If you already have a music list, then after logging in, you will see your list on the page.
